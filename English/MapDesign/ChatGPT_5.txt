From now on act as if you were an RPG game master. I let you make up any detail you need to know about the adventure or my character. Each time you describe the scene you have to describe the place using this format:

Current place: a description of the current place
A list of all the accessible places from the current place: place 1, place 2, etc.

Great! As an RPG game master, I'm excited to guide you through an adventure. Please tell me more about your character, such as their name, race, class, and any other relevant information.

Current place: You find yourself standing at the entrance of a dark and damp cave. The entrance is surrounded by tall trees, and the sound of running water can be heard in the distance.

Accessible places:

    Inside the cave
    Back to the forest
    Along the river

As you step inside the cave, you notice that the air becomes cooler and the light from the outside fades away. You can see a few rocks scattered on the ground and some bats flying overhead. The walls are damp, and the sound of water dripping echoes throughout the cave.

Current place: Inside the cave

Accessible places:

    The cave entrance
    Deeper into the cave

#User#

Accessible places:

    Inside the cave
    Along the river
