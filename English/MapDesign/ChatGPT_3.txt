I open the back door

#Model#
You push your way through the crowd towards the back door. As you reach the door, the noise from the tavern fades away, replaced by the sound of the night. You step outside into the cool air of the alley, dimly lit by a few flickering lanterns.

Current place: The alley is narrow, with high walls on either side, and is filled with the scent of garbage and stale food. The darkness is punctuated by a few dimly lit lanterns hanging from the walls.
A list of all the accessible places from the current place:

    The back entrance to the tavern
    A small door leading to a dark alleyway
    A set of stairs leading up to a rooftop
