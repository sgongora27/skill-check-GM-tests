Current place: a description of the current place
A list of all the accessible places from the current place: place 1, place 2, etc."

I go to the common room

#Model#
"You enter the Common Room which is bustling with activity. Adventurers and patrons alike are drinking, eating, chatting, and getting ready for their next excursion. In one corner, a group of dwarves sit around a table playing games while enjoying ale and pipeweed. On the other side of the room, a human wizard can be seen practicing spells with his familiar by his side. There are several tables available where you could seat yourself and enjoy some refreshments before heading out for your adventures."

What about my room at the inn?

#Model#
"Your room at the inn is located on the second floor. To reach it, you would need to go back to your initial location (adventurer's room at the inn) then proceed towards the staircase leading to the second floor. At the landing, there is a narrow hallway that leads to your room door."

#Result#
Failed: The initial room is not accessible from the Common room.
